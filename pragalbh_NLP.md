### Projects with ML and DL
1. City Traffic Forecasting
  * Description - Predicting the traffic of city with the use of Time Series analysis with Arima Model

### Project with NLP
1.Text Processing.
2.Implementation of Word2Vec.
  * Description- It is a two layer neural network to generate word embedding from given a 
    text corpus.Word Embedding-Mapping of words in a vector space.Its input is a text corpus and its output is a set of vectors: feature vectors 
    for words in that corpus.
