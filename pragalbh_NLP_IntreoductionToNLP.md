### Introduction to NLP
1. What is NLP :question:
  
  * Natural language processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence that helps computers understand, interpret and manipulate human language.
  * NLP draws from many disciplines, including computer science and computational linguistics, in its pursuit to fill the gap between human communication and computer understanding.
  * NLP is automated way to understand and analyze natural human language and extract information from such data by applying machine learning algorithm.
  * Eg :- Google Assistant application , it takes questions from human that can be written and spoken and answer them accordingly
